# Getting Started

Welcome! The current development documentation we use is created by Facebook, and it is known as React Native. It uses the universal common language known as JavaScript, but with weird twists and syntax. 
These links will be useful in getting tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference:
