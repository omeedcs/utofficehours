# Getting Started
Welcome! The current development documentation we use is created by Facebook, and it is known as React Native. It uses the universal common language known as JavaScript, but with weird twists and syntax. 

Here are a few resources to get you started if this is your first time with React Native:
https://reactnative.dev/
These links will be useful in getting tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

# What are the ideal development tools and environment?
We will be using VSCode and Expo client.
